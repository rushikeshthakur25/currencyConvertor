# Currency Converter

Currency Converter is a web application built with React that allows users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

## Features

- Convert between various currencies.
- Fetch real-time exchange rates from a currency API.
- User-friendly interface with input fields and live updates.
- Select and switch between different currencies.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/currency-converter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd currency-converter
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Obtain an API key from a currency exchange rate API provider (e.g., [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)).

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API key as follows:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the web application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

5. Select the source and target currencies, enter the amount, and see the converted amount.

### API Integration

- This project uses the currency exchange rate API to fetch exchange rates in real-time. Be sure to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in the `.env` file with your actual API key.
